            "task1": "The graph illustrates alterations in the population of Australian-born and non-Australian-born people
 who reside in cities, towns and urban areas
 from 1995 to 2010.



Overall
, the percentage of individuals who reside in urban areas
 increased dramatically. On the contrary
, more and more people
 choose to live outside the rural areas
 during a given time period. 



In 1995, the percentage of people
 who were born in Australia and lived in the cities was about 50% and that number rose to 65% in 2010. The data for the non-Australian population moved up 20%, from 60% in 1995 to 80% 15 years later. Compared with figures for rural residents both Australians and non-Australians plummeted sharply, where numbers decreased from 30% to 15% for Australian
 and from 40% to nearly 5% for foreigners.



On the other hand
, the number of people
 born in villages has decreased by at least 5% in all categories at the given time period. Even though, this
 change is relatively tiny when it is 
compared to the decline of
 percentage
 of birth in rural areas
. The birth rate of rural area
 in people
 born in Australia and outside Australia fallen
 from 30 and 40 % to 15 and 5% respectively which was the
 noteworthy alteration among the other statistics."""
